Donations to US Political Canidates by the Top 100 Political Action Committees
========================================================

- This App is for You!

Political Action Committes (PAC)
========================================================

Thanks to recent rulings by the US supreme Court, Corporations are now considered people too. This allows them to donate unlimited money to political candidates through various shell companies operating under the term Poltical Action Committees (PACs).Luckily for us (and democracy) they do have to file their donations with the US Federal Elections Commission.

The Federal Elections Committee maintains an extensive database of political contributions going back for the last several election cycles.

Using modern Data applications I have designed a handy app that will allow you to quickly see which candidate(s) the top 100 US Political Action Committees donated their funds to in the 2015/16 US Elections season.

Problem
========================================================


We all know that poltics is driven by big money, especially in America, but exactley how big is this problem?
- In the 2015/16 US Election cycle there are 5379 listed Poltical Action Committtes.  
- Together these PACs have so far spent $803,849,044 on influencing the US Elections.   
- To date these PACs have contributed $544,948,442 directly to US Politicians running for office.
- Of all of the PACs, the Top 100 PACS have contributed $312,224,975. This accounts for 57.3% of all PAC money given directly to US candidates.

DATA & LEGAL 
==========================================================

DATA & LEGAL DISCLAIMERS
- The data for this project was (legally) obtained from the US Federal Elections Commissions Website on 14 August 16 [www.fec.gov] (http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml)
- Reasonable effort was made to ensure that the presentation of the data is correct and free from ideological biases.
- However no guareentees about the accuarcy of the data presented to the FEC can be given (besides I'm sure that is a Federal Crime.)
- I assert that my preliminary findings are reasonably correct, but they have not been independently verified. 
- In other words, please don't sue me.
